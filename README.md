A really simple hello world type app in ruby , that I made quickly during a lunch and learn to show my fellow co-workers how to deploy
AWS Elastic Beanstalk rather then deploying to heroku, after I had showed them how do that we went ahead and also went through 
how to hook it up to a pipeline so that anytime something was pushed to github it would update in Amazon as well as the ability
stages along the one so broken code would not deploy
